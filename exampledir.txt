We take blocks of size s bytes. ..or bits, whatever is better
We will start counting blocks from the index 0
The start of the directory is always in the block 0
Imagine we have 10 blocks in use. s = 100
Block 0 is the directory.
Block 1-9 is the first file named first.txt with size 850 bytes.
Then the directory should look like this (line numbers for clarity.)

1. 0 //blocks of the directory omitting [] for parsing simplicity
2. "first.txt" txt 850 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 //filename, type, size, block_order

Then we add 50 byte file called second.png. Imagine that we discover that
there is not enough space for the directory. (this won't be the case for this example
but imagine it is). Then we append one more block for the directory (10) and one more for
the "second.png" file (11). The directory file then should look like this. We write it
to the blocks 0 and 10.

1. 0,10 // use getline(ss,s,',')
2. "first.txt" txt 850 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 //use getline(ss,s,' ') and then getline(ss,s,',') on the last one
3. "second.png" png 50 11
