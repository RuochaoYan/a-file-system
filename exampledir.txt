We take blocks of size s bytes. ..or bits, whatever is better
We will start counting blocks from the index 0
The start of the directory is always in the block 0
Imagine we have 10 blocks in use. s = 100
Block 0 is the directory.
Block 1-9 is the first file named first.txt with size 850 bytes.
Then the directory should look like this (line numbers for clarity.)

1. 1 // number of blocks in the directory omitting [] for parsing simplicity
2.    //Empty new line signifies that there are no empty blocks
3. "first.txt" txt 850 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 //filename, type, size, block_order

Then we add 50 byte file called second.png. Imagine that we also delete first.txt. 

1. 1 // use getline(ss,s,',')
2. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 // 1-9 are empty
3. first.txt txt 850 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 //use getline(ss,s,' ') and then getline(ss,s,',') on the last one
4. second.png png 50 11
