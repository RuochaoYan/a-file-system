A bit more challenging, a bit more work, but a lot more rewarding!

## Happy Birthday, Chloe

As the old saying goes, the Universe is full of possibility - so much so that anything that *can* happen in the Universe, probably already has. Once you realize that's true -- it becomes exceedingly difficult to feel *real* surprise at again.  At least that's what Chloe, the Director of Engineering at JobCo likes to tell herself. 

There are a common set of things the average person just "knows" to be true, once they reach a certain age. Not only do you know these things are true, but when you think of these things, the voice-in-your-head reminding you of them sounds suspiciously like your mother. "Wear clean underwear", you hear. "Don't run with scissors." Still other things, like the fact that there are no calories in a Frapucino, you learned in middle-school. And of course, everyone just knows that **Zombies** don't exist. Well, Zombie-wasps exist of course. But the smelly, slow-walking creepers that try to trap you in an alley are really just a profitable idea perpetrated on the public by Hollywood-types trying to sell movie tickets. 

The top-selling product at JobCo is called "Coin-Pops". Coin-Pops are inflatable baloons with a block-chain ledger, that keeps track of who last held each baloon before its inevitable, accidental, and unstoppable rise into the afternoon sky.  Like most Silicon Valley startups, the Coin-Pop product-team at JobCo is populated by a select group of star employees. Their task: to serve as a delegate for their customers, "feeeeel" what the customers "feeeeel", and build products that leave no doubt that JobCo has the best interests of their customers in mind, at any price. The rest of her team includes Morris, a 30-something finance-guy from Soho; Emilie, a UX designer (and semi-pro dancer); Rena from sales; and Carl, a Zombie who works in marketing, and whose verbs are, "slarrghh", "mmmrrf", and "glurrbgh". For Chloe, the fact that a few Zombies work in the marketing department leaves a bit of an eschatological dilemma. She likes to think she has an open mind, of course. But the trouble with having an open mind, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.

## Monday, 9:00am (PST)

Morris begins, "Ok all, let's get started...as you know our recent pro-forma offsite turned up some interesting customer-analytic metrics that have some at the home office worried." It would not be unfair to say that Morris was a bit of a poser. His real name, for instance, is not "Morris" - it's Alfred, and he is in fact from Nebraska, not London. He picked up the accent from mimicking Hugh Grant in the movie, Notting Hill. After droning on for a bit longer, Morris finished by saying, "The upshot of all this is that we need a new storage product in time to show at CES in 4 weeks!"

## Monday, 10:30am (PST)

The sprint-team meeting starts on time, and under budget, at precisely 10:30am. Rudy, the scrum-master, is a bit of stickler for timeliness. After completing their daily stand-up, Rudy asks whether anyone has any new business. "I have", said Chloe ambivalently. "Marketing has asked us to prepare a new storage product demo in time for CES in 4 weeks."
