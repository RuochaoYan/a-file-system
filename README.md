A bit more challenging, a bit more work, but a lot more rewarding!

## It's Chloe's World, We're Just Living In It

Chloe is the Director of Engineering at JobCo, a company that exists somewhere within a Universe full of possibility -- so much possibility in fact -- that anything that *can* happen, probably already has.  Chloe likes to believe that she has an open mind. But the trouble with having an open mind is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it. So despite the fact that everyone knows they don't exist, several Zombies are tenured and working in the Marketing Department. 

The top-selling product at JobCo is called "Coin-Pops". Coin-Pops are inflatable balloons with a block-chain ledger, that keeps track of who last held each balloon before its inevitable, accidental, and unstoppable rise into the afternoon sky. But as the price of bitcoin has begun to drop in recent months, so too has the market demand for Coin-Pops. So the CEO of JobCo assembled his amazing team of Marketing Zombies, and together they decided to ask for a new (non-existant) storage product in time to demonstrate at CES. In **FIVE** weeks.

## May The Best Team Win

If you're receiving this memo, then you and your team have been invited to build your version of the "The Product". 

Prior to demonstrating the product to customers, we will have a team-against-team competition. Whatever product performs the best will win, and be demonstrated by our Zombie Marketing team at CES!  

You and your team are expected to build a program that offers the functionality summarized below. 

### Feature 1 -- command processing

(details TBD)


### Feature 2 -- storage engine

(details TBD)


### Feature 3 -- searching

(details TBD)


### Feature 4 -- logging capabilities

(details TBD)



## The Requirements

1. Your solution must be built using C++, and all of the code must be your own, original code. 
2. You MAY use the C++ STL in your solution if you deem it appropriate to do so. No "3rd party" libraries may be used. 
3. Your solution must be a stand-alone application, capable of being run from the command line. 
4. You cannot use external applications or services to do the work; your application must implement all the functionality. 

## Submitting Your Solution

1. To enter the competition, your team must submit a working (makeable) solution on github, on or before the deadline.
2. Your team must submit a 1-3 page paper describing the technical design concepts you used in your solution.
3. Your team must submit a 1-page "Marketing Brochure" that describes your product, highlights your team, and offers reasons why your solution should be chosen over your competitors. Since this is a marketing document, your submission must be witty, exciting, interesting and compelling. 

## Choosing a Winner

The Zombies in Marketing are awaiting your submissions. Here's how they will score your work:

### 1. Working Application (45pts)

Vlad-the-Compiler will build your application, and test it using an automated suite of tests. Your solution will recieve 10pts for each completed functional test, so long as you complete all tasks withing the standard time window.

If your solution doesn't build at all, you will receive 0 points in this category.

### 2. Performance and Efficiency (30pts)

Your solution will be measured and stack ranked along the dimensions of total performance and memory efficiency. 

#### Performance 
- Solutions in the 1st quartile in performance will receive 10 points
- Solutions in the 2nd quartile in performance will receive 8 points
- Solutions in the 3rd quartile in performance will receive 6 points
- Solutions in the 4th quartile in performance will recieve 4 points

#### Memory Efficiency
- Solutions in the 1st quartile in memory efficiency will receive 10 points
- Solutions in the 2nd quartile in memory efficiency will receive 8 points
- Solutions in the 3rd quartile in memory efficiency will receive 6 points
- Solutions in the 4th quartile in memory efficiency will recieve 4 points

### 3. Technical Design Summary (1-3 pages) (15pts)

Technical design papers should describe the approach the technical team took in solving the problem.  We can read your code, so this paper should describe the design ideas, challenges, and outline your solutions. Teams who fail to submit this paper will receive 0 points in this category. And don't even think about making us grab our red correction pen.

### 4. Marketing Brochure (1 page) (5pts)

The Marketing Brochure is a 1-page paper whose only purpose is to SELL your team and your idea. You need to convince our Zombies that you *really* understand their needs, who they are, what they want, and most of all, that you have a sense of humor. Teams who fail to submit this paper will receive 0 points in this category. 

### 5. That "Something" Extra... (5pts)

Style matters. Confidence matters too. So do bribes, but our CEO frowns on that, so they're out of bounds. Otherwise, show us some great team spirit. Show us a team who works well together. Show us rock solid code, contributed by everyone on your team.

### Summary Score

Your submission will recieve a maximum of 100 points, aggregated from the points you earn in each of the 5 categories.
