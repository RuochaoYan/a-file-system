A bit more challenging, a bit more work, but a lot more rewarding!

## Happy Birthday, Chloe

As the old saying goes, the Universe is full of possibility - and anything that *can* happen in the Universe, probably already has. Once you realize that's true -- it becomes exceedingly difficult to feel *real* surprise at again.  At least that's what Chloe, the Director of Engineering at JobCo likes to tell herself. 

Chloe recently celebrated her 25th birthday, complete with a family dinner at home with her Mom and Dad. After enjoying her favorite meal (Juicy sandwiches and garlic potatos), it was time for an off-key rendition of Happy Birthday over a cake, and a time to open her gift. Chloe loves her parents, no doubt about it, and is thankful for them every day. Even more so, it seems, when their birthday gift ideas turn out to be a little, well, trite. It took real effort for Chloe to feign surprise when she opened her gift -- a classic coffee mug, with the inscription, "World's Biggest Nerd." Chloe beamed and smiled, and thanked her parents appropriately for their thoughtfulness. Truth was, that on the inside, Chloe didn't feel as though she was even *close* to being the "Worlds Biggest..." _anything_.
